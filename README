# VeNom Coding Support

This module creates the table structure for VeNom coding support. Three tables
are created, venom_dx, venom_dx_test, and venom_proc. Currently, this module
just secures a namespace and installs the tables. The ability to actually
import records requires changes to the codebase (which will be submitted) via
a PR to allow support or by improving the Event dispatcher.

## venom_dx
This table includes all codes with a subset of diagnosis.

## venom_dx_test
This table includes all codes with a subset of diagnostic tests.

## venom_proc
This table includes all codes with a subset of procedure

Note, this module does not provide the actual VeNom codes, those must be
secured by the end user separately and placed in a specific location on the
filesystem in OpenEMR. To acquire the VeNom code set, visit
